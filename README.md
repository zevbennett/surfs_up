# Hawaii Temperature Analysis


## Overview
The pupose of this analsyis is to calculate temperature averages in the months of June and December in Oahu over a number of years, in order to determine the feasability of an ice cream stand on the island. 

----------

## Results

The statistical summary for the averages over all the months of Jume is:

- In the first, second, and third quartiles the averages of june are only about degrees higher
- The high of all the months of June is 85 and all the December months is 83, which is pretty close.

## Summary

In order to determine the feasability of an ice cream stand, temperature is not the only factor. Importantly we need to check for precipitation. 
Two additional queries that should be performed are:
- Precipitation in June
- Precipitation in December
